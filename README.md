## About

This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing performance trends across computational kernels within the RAJA Performance Suite (RAJAPerf) [1]. RAJAPerf is a benchmark suite developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) that evaluates the performance portability of key computational kernels on high-performance computing (HPC) systems.

This repository provides tools for transforming performance data collected from RAJAPerf runs into `.csv` format and visualizing key performance trends. The analysis leverages data from `.cali` files generated by the [Caliper profiler](https://software.llnl.gov/Caliper/) when running RAJAPerf on [LLNL’s Lassen supercomputer](https://hpc.llnl.gov/hardware/compute-platforms/lassen), which features POWER9 CPUs and V100 GPUs.

The primary objectives of this project include:

- Data Transformation to CSV: The csv_generation.ipynb notebook converts `.cali` files into `.csv` format for easier analysis and use in SBM models.
- CSV Data Visualization: The `plot_analysis.ipynb` notebook generates comparative visualizations to examine performance scaling trends, identify bottlenecks through top-down metrics [2], and assess the impact of problem sizes and parallel execution strategies like the number of ranks.
